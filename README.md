## Description

This project is a demonstration of data engineering principles applied to automate the retrieval of weather data for London, UK, using an external API. The primary objective is to showcase the automation of data collection tasks with the help of GitHub Actions, specifically through the use of cron jobs.

### Aim of the Project

The aim of this project is threefold:

1. **Data Retrieval**: To collect weather data for London, UK, from an external API, serving as an example of real-world data extraction.

2. **Automation**: To automate this data retrieval process, demonstrating how cron jobs in GitHub Actions can be used to schedule and execute recurring tasks at specified intervals.

3. **Documentation**: To provide a detailed example for data engineering audiences, highlighting the workflow setup, Python scripting, and logging procedures, which are vital for robust data collection and analysis workflows.

### What You Will Learn

By exploring this project, data engineering professionals will gain insights into the following:

- Setting up GitHub Actions workflows for automation.
- Handling environment variables for sensitive data.
- Creating and maintaining log files for debugging and monitoring.
- Making HTTP requests to fetch data from an API.
- Managing Python dependencies with a `requirements.txt` file.
